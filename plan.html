<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan - CossiePlay</h1>

<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>The  Cozzieplay web site is intended to increase revenue for Cossieplay by promoting  monthly cosplay parties and costume making services offered by the company. This  is through means of generating new and repeat customers. </p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>As this is the first website used by Cossieplay, all  other advertising will be consistent for a 3 month period so that any increase  in sales and attendance numbers will be attributed to the website. The figures  will be compared to that of the previous 3 months and then to the same months  of previous years to account for annual fluctuations.&nbsp; </p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>As the current clientele is predominantly older  (35-50) the target site will be targeted at a younger audience of high school  and young adults, both new and old to cosplay.</p>
