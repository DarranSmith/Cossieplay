          <p><h2>What is Cosplay?</h2>
          <p><br>
         <img src="group2.jpg" alt="" width="125" align="right" alt="Cosplayers" hspace="20"/>Cosplay, a portmanteau of the words <strong>costume play</strong>, is a performance art in which participants called <strong>cosplayers</strong> wear costumes and fashion accessories to represent a specific character. Cosplayers often interact to create a subculture and a broader use of the term "<em>cosplay</em>" applies to any costumed role-playing in venues apart from the stage. Any entity that lends itself to dramatic interpretation may be taken up as a subject and it is not unusual to see genders switched. Favorite sources include manga and anime, comic books and cartoons, video games, and live-action films and television series.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The rapid growth in the number of people cosplaying as a hobby since 1990 has made the phenomenon a significant aspect of<strong> popular culture</strong> in Japan and some other parts of Asia and in the Western world. Cosplay events are common features of fan conventions and there are also <strong>dedicated conventions</strong> and local and international competitions, as well as social networks, websites and other forms of media centered on cosplay activities.</p>
